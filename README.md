# RAG-NLP-bigfoot-sighting
I performed RAG on the mistral model to enable the model to discuss in depth bigfoot related informations.

The dataset I used to empower the model is https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data/workspace/file?filename=bfro_reports_geocoded.csv

The code was based on the work done in this repository: https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide/blob/main/notebooks/pe-rag.ipynb

I worked on this project alongside Alex Orlandi and Jiayi Qi.
