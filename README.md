# RAG NLP: bigfoot sighting
I performed RAG on the Mistral model to enable the model to discuss in depth BigFoot related informations. Through RAG it is possible to enable a model to "learn" about a certain topic that might not be included, or properly included, in the data  it was trained on. Bigfoot stories and information seemed like a funny enough topic that Mistral might not be very good at. Check out what it learned!

The code was based on the work done [here](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide/blob/main/notebooks/pe-rag.ipynb)
