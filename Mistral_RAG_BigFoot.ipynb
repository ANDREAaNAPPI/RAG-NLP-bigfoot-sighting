I saw a bigfoot in 1995, in the evening, at around 9 p.m., running. It was at least 7 ft tall, hairy, and fast....in a weird way. I saw it running across route 82 in Sagamore Hills Ohio. It was running along the bike path which is located near a small Plaza with a Marcs located in it. It was dark, but I know it couldn't be human and it wasn't a bear, for it was more upright. It ran too fast and was too tall for it to be a man. It was hairy, but we were driving 45, so I can't get detailed. I think you should look into observing the CVNRA, especially behind Boston Mills Ski Resort. Start at Blue Hen Falls.\n",

It was mid febuary and I thought what kids would be out with no shoes this time of year.  I joked to myself \"baby bigfoot\".  The tracks in soft mudd showed very clearly had no arch.   At the time I didnt think a bigfoot would live around here and just went on my way.  It wasnt till i read the report of a sighting one mile from this location that I considered fileing this report.  one other detail the creases in the print looked the texture of a crumbled paper bag.not smooth. I would guess the sizes 8 and 10 (shoe size)  I ride alone alot and would rather not have bigfoot around here.\n",

The space between the foot prints was way to wide to be human. We didn't use plaster for an impression or get a picture, but we both know it was bigfoot. My father inlaw saw them too and could'nt explain them. It is kinda neat to think a bigfoot walked threw our yard right in front of our house.

            "I have talked to others who have heard or have seen what may be a Bigfoot. While talking to a fisherman he told me in 2000 that many people were hearing cries around the Scioto River. While along the river I have heard the same cries. It sounded like it was calling out another creature. The cries echoed up the river for about a 1/4 mile. The spring of that same year while walking around Lake White just north of a residential area I saw what I believe to be a Bigfoot. It seemed to be a younger one but just as tall. It appeared more manlike than ape-like. I could not believe my eyes so I bent down to get a better look as it moved rapidly behind a tree. As I looked it peeked from around the tree and looked at me. My mind said this is what they call a Bigfoot. As it moved so did the deer that were right behind me. I bolted and so did the deer. I think it was hunting the deer and the deer knew this. When I walked by the deer they stood still, then I saw the Bigfoot. The deer seemed confused on which direction to run away. This creature seemed to move very stealthlike like a kung fu like movement all in one motion. It seemed very smart and not afraid of me. It seems these animals travel the waterways as we do roads.\n",

            "Newspaper article: published November 7, 1997 in the Pioneer Press. (from the AP wire) [Are Big Footprints Bigfoot's? RICE LAKE, WIS. Bigfoot in Wisconsin? That's the possibility under investigation in the Rice Lake area, about 70 miles northeast of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Brad Mortenson of the U.S. Expedition and Exploration Society said three tracks found Monday could be from the mysterious -- some say mythical -- ape-like creature known as Bigfoot. He describes the tracks as about 16 to 17 1/2 inches long and 8 inches wide at the widest. Asked about the shape, he said: ``It looks like a big foot. It's very distinct.'' One print showed five toes, he said, and the impressions indicated a creature with a stride of about 4 1/2 feet, typical for the Bigfoot. Mortenson, 41, of Sarona, said he started receiving reports about possible Bigfoot activity after a local newspaper story two weeks ago told about his work with the society, based in Doris, Calif. ``After that we started getting the reports of people across the tracks in the Blue Hills,'' he said. That's the hilly, wooded region around the Barron County-Rusk County linewhere a preliminary search turned up the tracks this week, he said. He said he planned to do more preliminary searching, and if enough signs are found, the society would bring in equipment and personnel for a full search. ``I'd like to be a little more certain . . . before I commit the society to the expense of a full-scale expedition,'' he said. The Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, is said to inhabit remote regions of the Pacific Northwest, but Mortenson said there also have been a lot of sightings in Florida , Ohio and Maine. He said he became involved searching for Bigfoot in northern California in the 1970s, and he now serves as the society's international director of operations.\n",
            "Newspaper article: published November 7, 1997 in the Pioneer Press. (from the AP wire) [Are Big Footprints Bigfoot's? RICE LAKE, WIS. Bigfoot in Wisconsin? That's the possibility under investigation in the Rice Lake area, about 70 miles northeast of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Brad Mortenson of the U.S. Expedition and Exploration Society said three tracks found Monday could be from the mysterious -- some say mythical -- ape-like creature known as Bigfoot. He describes the tracks as about 16 to 17 1/2 inches long and 8 inches wide at the widest. Asked about the shape, he said: ``It looks like a big foot. It's very distinct.''

At the time I didnt think a bigfoot would live around here and just went on my way.  It wasnt till i read the report of a sighting one mile from this location that I considered fileing this report.  one other detail the creases in the print looked the texture of a crumbled paper bag.not smooth. I would guess the sizes 8 and 10 (shoe size)  I ride alone alot and would rather not have bigfoot around here.\n",

These areas may provide suitable habitats for bigfoot, as they offer ample cover and food sources. Additionally, the presence of bigfoot research teams in these areas may indicate a higher likelihood of encountering the creature. However, it is important to note that bigfoot sightings are generally considered to be unproven and many people do not believe in their existence.\n",

I came around a bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the hips and two hairy legs walking across the road. Definitely not a human. Took one step from the center of my lane and with one step, not a run, was over the sideline and into the woods. I was about 19 at the time. No one believes me to this day. I was told by my mom about a year later that the cars that were always parked on the top of the mountain was a bigfoot research team. Makes sense. Have you ever considered checking Ringwood out?\n",

They are described as being over 6 feet tall, with long matted hair, heavy set, and a \"fat head\" and whiskers. Bigfoot have been observed in remote areas, such as Holson Valley Road and behind Boston Mills Ski Resort in the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area. They tend to move stealthily and are often seen running along bike paths or waterways. Some witnesses have described bigfoot as being more manlike than ape-like in appearance, while others have reported seeing a younger, hairier creature that moved rapidly and was more upright.

            "I have talked to others who have heard or have seen what may be a Bigfoot. While talking to a fisherman he told me in 2000 that many people were hearing cries around the Scioto River. While along the river I have heard the same cries. It sounded like it was calling out another creature. The cries echoed up the river for about a 1/4 mile. The spring of that same year while walking around Lake White just north of a residential area I saw what I believe to be a Bigfoot. It seemed to be a younger one but just as tall. It appeared more manlike than ape-like. I could not believe my eyes so I bent down to get a better look as it moved rapidly behind a tree. As I looked it peeked from around the tree and looked at me. My mind said this is what they call a Bigfoot. As it moved so did the deer that were right behind me. I bolted and so did the deer. I think it was hunting the deer and the deer knew this. When I walked by the deer they stood still, then I saw the Bigfoot. The deer seemed confused on which direction to run away. This creature seemed to move very stealthlike like a kung fu like movement all in one motion. It seemed very smart and not afraid of me. It seems these animals travel the waterways as we do roads.\n",

This creature seemed to move very stealthlike like a kung fu like movement all in one motion. It seemed very smart and not afraid of me. It seems these animals travel the waterways as we do roads.\n",

            "The bigfoot behavior in the Norman, Oklahoma area has been characterized by sightings, footprints, vocalizations, and other incidents. In 1976, two sightings were reported and footprints were taken. In January 2003, a sighting was reported by a family member. In 2000, a fisherman reported hearing cries around the Scioto River and in 2003, a man saw what he believed to be a bigfoot near Lake White. The bigfoot is described as being tall, with a slight hunch, and moving stealthily like a kung fu fighter. It is also reported to be intelligent and not afraid of humans.

            "OBSERVATIONS: My family resides close to Norman, Oklahoma, and from 1976 to the present, there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot, including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003, footprints in both mud and snow, several incidents where vocalization was heard, and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown, foul odor being smelled, fruit being taken off of trees, etc. Back in 1976, Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature. The most recent sighting happened in January of this year. My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods. It was early evening and he was just about to finish when he happened to look up and caught the sight of the creature out of the corner of his eye. At that point, the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him, standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down). He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch.  He froze for a minute and then dropped the wood that was in his hands and ran inside of the house. By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister, he was \"as white as a ghost.\" The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in. He was having difficulty breathing and therefore was having a hard time speaking. All he could say was \"Buh...buh...buh...\" My sister and niece thought he was having a heart attack and were fearing for his life. When he was finally able to calm down, all he could get out was \"Bigfoot.  I just saw Bigfoot.\" Since my brother-in-law was snapping kindling over his knees, we have come to the conclusion that it was this noise that drew the creature to him.\n",

            "I have talked to others who have heard or have seen what may be a Bigfoot. While talking to a fisherman he told me in 2000 that many people were hearing cries around the Scioto River. While along the river I have heard the same cries. It sounded like it was calling out another creature. The cries echoed up the river for about a 1/4 mile. The spring of that same year while walking around Lake White just north of a residential area I saw what I believe to be a Bigfoot. It seemed to be a younger one but just as tall. It appeared more manlike than ape-like. I could not believe my eyes so I bent down to get a better look as it moved rapidly behind a tree. As I looked it peeked from around the tree and looked at me. My mind said this is what they call a Bigfoot. As it moved so did the deer that were right behind me. I bolted and so did the deer. I think it was hunting the deer and the deer knew this.

            "My daughters, about 12 and 14 at the time, about 1977, were sitting on a small stone wall joining our patio in the backyard and I was up in the front yard. It was dusk, almost nightfall with very little daylight left. All of a sudden our three dogs ran down the gravel driveway from the front to the back of the house barking vigorously. I ran to the back of the house to find out what they were barking at. Here I encountered my two daughters; I asked them what the dogs were barking at. At this point in time there was no talk of a Bigfoot in Ohio, we never thought of anything being a Bigfoot. We had heard of a \"Sasquatch\" in the northwestern states but heard nothing of a Bigfoot in Ohio. My daughters told me that a large man ran right past them about 10 feet away running in a westerly direction. I said to them, “Well when he runs into the barb wire fence, we will hear it.” The dogs at this time were still barking and had followed this man in the direction towards the fence. They then stopped barking and returned to us. We never heard the man hit the barbwire fence. (No yelling and cussing) The girls described to me that this man was very tall, had unusually long strides, and was running very fast, they also perceived that the man had a \"cape-like\" thing that was flowing out behind him as he ran. As we later discussed this incident we could not figure out what this \"cape-like\" thing could have been. We live in a rural area, and we have 15 acres of property with a horse pasture, we thought what man would be running through a rural area at almost dark. We thought he might have been a jogger or cross country trainer late in getting home, and started running through people’s property to get home as it was almost dark. Years later as we heard about a possible \"Bigfoot\" in Ohio, which led to a discussion with my two daughters, now much older, about what they had seen in 1977. We discussed the \"cape-like\" thing that this so called jogger had on. We had as yet not figured out what this \"cape-like\" thing could have been until our knowledge about a possible Ohio Bigfoot. In talking about it with my daughters we came to the conclusion that this might have been a Bigfoot that they saw. And the cape was actually flowing hair from this possible Bigfoot. We also questioned how this \"runner\" could have got over the fence without hitting it. If it was a Bigfoot it probably leaped over the fence on the run. This incident comes up in family discussions from time to time. We decided to file this report as the topic of Ohio Bigfoot has become more pronounced in our family.\n",
